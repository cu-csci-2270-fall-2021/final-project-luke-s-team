# CSCI 2275 â€“ Data Structures - Final Project
Luke Fitzpatrick & Maxwell Chang 

This project is a local repository for storing files, similar to GitHub.
  
Starting the program prompts the user to enter one of seven options.
Options Include:
  
1 - Initialize the repository. Doing so will allow functionality for all other options.
  
2 - Add a file to the repository. The user must enter a valid file name for the file to be added. 
Furthermore, the file must already exist in the directory that the program is run from. 
  
3 - Remove a file from the repository. Must be a valid file name that exists in the current repository.
  
4 - Commit all added files, removed files, and changes made to files to the repository. All these changes will be saved as a commit. 
When committing a version, the user will be prompted to enter a valid commit message. The message must be no longer than three words. 
If no changes have been made since the last commit, then a new commit will not be made.
  
5 - Return to a previous commit. The user must enter a valid commit number to return to. 
If the user chooses to move forward, all local changes in the directory will be lost and return to whatever was saved in the commit chosen to return to. 
If not on the most recent commit, then the user cannot add, remove, or commit any files.
  
6 - Search for a commit number based on a keyword. If the word entered matches any words in any previous commit messages, 
then the version associated with that message will be displayed to the user. 
  
7 - Quit the program. Doing so will delete the entire repository.
